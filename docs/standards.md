# Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the project-specific customizations and standards that deviate from or extend industry best practices. For most development conventions, we follow industry-standard guidelines documented in our [references.md](./references.md).

## Commit Standards

```
[TYPE]: [Brief description]
```

- `FEATURE`: New feature or enhancement
- `FIX`: Bug fixes
- `DOCS`: Documentation changes
- `STYLE`: Code style/formatting (no code change)
- `REFACTOR`: Code refactoring (no functional change)
- `TEST`: Adding/modifying tests
- `CHORE`: Build, dependencies, config, new, delete, change

**Guidelines:**

- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
- Keep it concise but descriptive
- Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- The type is always all CAPS
- Don't end with a period
