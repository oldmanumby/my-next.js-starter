# AI Project Review

This file is to update AI at the start of a new chat coding thread so the AI understands what work has already been performed.

AI is instructed to perform the following:

- Review all documents in the 'docs' folder. Pay close attention to the 'rules-global.md', 'rules-project.md', 'tech-stack.md', and 'standards.md'.
- Review the 'package.json' file
- Review the Gitea repo for this project (see 'rules-project.md'), specifically the project roadmap
- Review the current CHANGELOG.md file
- Review the 'references.md' file for links to documentation, best practices and standards.

Once the review is complete, the developer will present the next task needing to be done.
